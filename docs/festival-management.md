# Daily Festival Management

Your festival is live - now let's keep it running smoothly. This guide covers everything you need for day-to-day operations and keeping your audience engaged.

## Lineup Management

### Headliner Setup

Your headliners are the stars of your festival. Here's how to make them shine:

**Text vs Image Options**:
- **Text only**: Clean, simple, loads fast
- **With images**: More engaging, 4x higher favorite rates
- **Recommended**: Use high-quality images (500x500px) for top 5-10 artists

**Best practices**:
1. **Order by importance** - Your biggest names should appear first
2. **Consistent image quality** - Mixed quality looks unprofessional  
3. **Artist bios** - 1-2 sentences, focus on why they're exciting

### Stage Organization

**Importance Ordering**:
Stages are displayed in order of importance. Your main stage should be first, smaller stages last.

To reorder stages:
1. Go to "Schedule Management" ‚Üí "Stages"
2. Drag and drop to reorder
3. Most important = leftmost column in user view

**Stage naming tips**:
- Keep names short: "Main Stage" not "The Epic Main Festival Stage Experience"
- Use familiar terms: "East Stage" vs "Cosmic Consciousness Arena"
- Be consistent: If one is "Stage", make them all "Stage"

### Artist Scheduling

**Day and Time Slots**:
1. Navigate to "Schedule Management"
2. Drag artists from lineup to time slots
3. **Conflict detection**: System warns if artists overlap
4. **Buffer time**: Build in 15-30 minutes between acts

**Pro scheduling tips**:
- **Popular times fill first**: Schedule major acts during peak hours
- **Genre flow**: Consider how artists complement each other
- **Bathroom breaks**: Leave gaps during less popular acts

### Adding Non-Music Activities

Don't forget about the full festival experience:

**What to include**:
- Food vendors and timing
- Art installations and locations  
- Workshops and experiences
- Meet & greets
- Merch booths

**How to add**:
1. Go to "Lineup Management" ‚Üí "Add Activity"
2. Select "Non-Music Activity"
3. Add location, timing, and description

### Quick Edit Tips

- **Copy from last year**: Duplicate previous festival as starting point
- **Quick stage assign**: Select multiple artists, assign to stage
- **Time adjustments**: Select multiple slots, shift all by X minutes

**Emergency changes**:
